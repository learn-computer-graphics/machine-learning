# Unity ML-Agents Toolkit

ML-Agents is an open-source project that enables games and simulations to serve as environments for training intelligent agents. It includes a C# SDK to set up a scene and define the agents within it, and a state-of-the-art machine learning library to train agents for 2D, 3D, and VR/AR environments.
